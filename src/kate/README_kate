How to enable syntax highlighting in text editor 'kate'

(1) Place the xml file (cseis.xml) in the syntax directory of the kate text editor. The local directory is located in:
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax
If this directory does not exist, create it.
(System location is sometimes: /usr/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax)

(2) Next, start kate and open a SeaSeis flow file, or create a new/empty one (must have .flow extension)

(3) In the menu, select Menu->Tool->Highlighting->Scientific->SeaSeis
From now on, all SeaSeis flows should be automatically associated with this syntax format.
