*** HOW TO INSTALL ***

Linux installation - quick overview
1) Extract downloaded tar file into arbitrary directory
   For example:
   mkdir /opt/seaseis; cp seaseis_v2.03.tgz /opt/seaseis; cd /opt/seaseis;
   tar xfz seaseis_v2.03.tgz
   The tar file will extract into directory: /opt/seaseis/seaseis_v2.03
2) Review compiler settings
   If necessary, change compilers at the top of the bash script make_seaseis.sh
3) Run make
   cd /opt/seaseis/seaseis_v2.03
   ./make_seaseis.sh
4) Add Seaseis bin directory to your binary path
   bash:  export PATH=${PATH}:/opt/seaseis/bin
   tcsh:  set path = ($path /opt/seaseis/bin)
5) Run seaseis/seaview
   seaseis -h
   seaview.sh
